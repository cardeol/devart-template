-- ASCII ART --


ASCII stand for "American Standard Code for Information Interchange".

This Standard was created by the American National Standards Institute. It is a table of numbers and their corresponding symbols used in computer typography. It covers letters, numbers and certain control codes as TABS or ENTER.

Essentially, ASCII art is creating graphics from ASCII codes, motivated by a need in the old days when most computers din't even display graphics.
