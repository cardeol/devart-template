This project was originally thought as a tribute to the old-fashioned ASCII Art, rendering a video stream using a Webcam converting into ASCII symbols using Angularjs and HTML5. 

The main idea is using a landscape vertical TV with a web browser and a camera to provide a kind of mirror view with an ASCII perspective.

## ASCII Codes

ASCII stand for "American Standard Code for Information Interchange".

This Standard was created by the American National Standards Institute. 
It is a table of numbers and their corresponding symbols used in computer typography. 
It covers letters, numbers and certain control codes as TABS or ENTER.

### ASCII Art

Essentially, ASCII art is creating graphics from ASCII codes, motivated by a need in the old days when most computers din't even display graphics. 
The term is also loosely used to refer to text based visual art in general. ASCII art can be created with any text editor, and is often used with free-form languages. 
Most examples of ASCII art require a fixed-width font (non-proportional fonts, as on a traditional typewriter) such as Courier for presentation. (Wikipedia)

<b>Alice in Wonderland</b> was published a few years before the typewriter was invented. Therefore it can be considered as one of the first printed text art creations.

The following tail of a mouse is from Chapter III, "A Caucus Race and a Long Tale": 
```
'It  is  a long tail, certainly said Alice, looking down
with wonder at the Mouse's tail; 'but why do you call it
sad?'  And  she  kept  on  puzzling  about  it while the
Mouse was speaking, so that her idea  of  the  tale  was
something like this:- 'Fury said to a
                   mouse, That
                     he met in the
                          house, "Let
                              us both go
                                 to law: I
                                 will prosec-
                                  cute you --
                                Come, I'll
                             take no de-
                         nial:  We
                     must  have
                 the trial;
               For really
             this morn-
           ing I've
          nothing
         to do."
          Said the
           mouse to
            the cur,
             "Such   a
               trial, dear
                   sir, With

                        or judge,

                 "I'll be
               judge,
            I'll be
          jury,"
         said
        cun-

          old
           Fury;
             "I'll

                  whole
