The original prototype was entirely written in HTML 4 and flash for the image capture.
But it was quite slow, and although if written in older technology would make it accessible to a much broader audience, 
it misses the point of technology advancement. Also it was much more unpleaseant to use.
And the main point of this project is for people to be able to interact and feel comfortable with.

That's is why we decided to give it a try and we rewrote the entire algorithm in HTML 5.
The result surpassed my own expectations. The new prototype was much faster and smoother than the original version.
It was an acceptable performance in Firefox and a really good one in Chrome.
Also it reduced significantly the amount of Javascript needed for the algorithm to run.
