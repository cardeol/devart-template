The original prototype was entirely written in HTML 4 and flash for the image capture testing with different plugins and jQuery.

But it was quite slow, and although if written in older technology would make it accessible to a much broader audience, it misses the point of technology advancement. Also it was much more unpleaseant to use. The main pourpose of this project is that people feel have a realtime feedback of their own images.

Thati is why we decided to give it a try and we rewrote the entire algorithm in HTML5 with Angularjs. The result exceed our own expectations. The new prototype was much faster and smoother than the original version. It was an acceptable performance in Firefox and a really good one in Chrome.Also it reduced significantly the amount of Javascript needed for the algorithm to run.
