We were thinking in new renderers for this project, things like:

### 8 bit renderer ###

The main idea is to simulate the games of the 80's. It should be easy, just activating block mode and reducing to colors to an 8-bit palette.

### Warhol style ###

(can of Campell's soup or Marilyn Monroe)


### Differents Colour sets ###

It is important to be able to recognize lines or limits.
It could be done by comparing contrasts of colours, but I need to test first.

### Impressionism renderer ###

It should be a medium difficulty. It could be done with a mix of the ascii renderer and the block mode, 
but i'd rather try to do another type of transformation.

### Van Gogh renderer ###
Using lines/curves, instead of blocks

### Mondrian Renderer ###
Should be really fast with html 5, as it involves huge blocks.

### The "Take On Me" renderer ###
Absolute dream. Possible only if we managed to the the warhol first and simplifing the lines a lot a removing all colours.

### Also needs white walls!!! (even on the video there are white walls!!!) ###

(It would be a really cool way to learn about art if we could do a render of different artists and see how would you look like you were drawn today)
